Hi, I'm Todd and I'm a photographer specializing in Weddings, Senior Portraits & Newborn Portraits.


<!-- This is why we feel that your photography is an investment rather than an extravagance and we treat you as people rather than a date marked off the calendar. From our smallest package to our largest, we are here every step of the way, no further than a call, text, or email away. -->

Your special day deserves the care and extra attention that comes with you like that special friend, the one who wants you to adopt Felipe's baby. But deep down, you know you are just too into your candy crushes to really know what time you're missing.  

And that's where I come in. I AM paying attention (because you're paying me) and so I strive to capture those timeless moments and even the ones of your mother-in-law and the gang of 5 over at table 6. 

All of the Wedding Packages are completely customizable! That's right, I can custom create a package of your dreams. Like Hasselhoff smashing a burger, I lay it on... and do everything possible to make sure your day is a magical one.

If you are more of the cheap-minded and can't afford a normal package, we have starter packages that will be right up the alley! Be sure to ask about our coupon days on Thursday nights.

Because weddings are the single-most expensive day of your lives, please don't forget to feed your photographer. Thanks!
